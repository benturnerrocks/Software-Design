Slow build, fantastic storyteller , I wouldn't even call patrick an author, he has such storyteller skills there are stories wrapped up in stories. Great method of using words as pictures. This is truely a read for lovers of books. You need some patience to fully grasp what is going on here, but it's worth it. Well done ."

Just as good as the Harry Potter series but more logical magic. The third installment has taken more than a decade now. Won't even remember the story when the third book releases. Dear Mr. Rothfuss, make some effort and try to finish the book before we forget the characters.  It is going to be nostalgic though."

I always prefered that as it dwelves your imagination with each word into a sensation in it's own. And it turned out to be a hell of a ride with every page through this engaging, raw, intelligent, intense, epic saga! Heavily waiting for the next book.It's highly detailed and very long..some may hate the detailings but it's worth it. Must read for book lovers."

There is far too much going on that to even hint at some of it is to take away surprises that are part of the thrill of reading Martinâ€™s work."

I loved all the story arcs - Jaime, Arya, Brienne, Dornish Plot, Ironborn, and travels of Samwell Tarly to Oldtown. The character of Prince Doran Martell is a good find. I am rooting for Dorne and especially House Nymeros Martell. Don't try to fast-read or Quick-read this Book. It is a vintage of different cadre. Drink or sip it slowly and see how wonderful it tastes!"
