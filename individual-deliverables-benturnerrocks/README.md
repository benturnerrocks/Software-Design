# individual-deliverables-benturnerrocks
Created Wednesday, April 6th by GitHub Classroom

This repository is made to store individual deliverables for CS257 (software design).

The **individual-deliverables-benturnerrocks** folder contains aspects of the project before SQL integration solely written by me. This includes:
  - a flask app *FlaskLab* using dummy data
  - a front-end *HTML and CSS Lab* focusing not on the data but instead on learning the aesthetics of the UI
  - a front-end *favoriteBookWebsite* using fabricated book data
  - testing files for Flask App and command-line interface using the "unittest" library
  - txt files produced or used by the files
  - a *merge_data.py* that
  - a *makePopularList.py* that creates "popularTitles.txt", which keeps track of popular titles based on their search count using our site
  - a *main.py* and *main_updated.py* that
