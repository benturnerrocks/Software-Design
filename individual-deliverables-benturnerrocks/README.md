# individual-deliverables-benturnerrocks
Created Wednesday, April 6th by GitHub Classroom

This repository is made to store individual deliverables for CS257 (software design).

The **individual-deliverables-benturnerrocks** folder contains aspects of the project solely written by me. This includes:
  - a test flask app *FlaskLab* using dummy data
  - a test front-end *HTML and CSS Lab* focusing not on the data but instead on learning the aesthetics of the UI
  - a test front-end *favoriteBookWebsite* using fabricated book data
