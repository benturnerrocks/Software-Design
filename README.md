# Software Design
This repository contains project work for our Flask project on streaming services in CS257 (Software Design) at Carleton College. This was created focusing on Agile methodologies as well as using Git version control through GitHub.

The **individual-deliverables-benturnerrocks** folder contains aspects of the project delivered by just me. It includes some code by teammates but my key contributions include the random function, both of the search functionalities, the parser, and the testing. I created and prioritized the switch to OOP using a Movie class. This includes:
  - a preliminary flask app *FlaskLab* using dummy data
  - experimental front-ends *HTML and CSS Lab* and *favoriteBookWebsite* using fabricated data
  - testing files using the Unittest library
  - a CLI *main.py* and *main_updated.py* that includes the main core functionalities of our app

The **team-project-team-e-1** folder contains the full project in collaboration with Andreas Miller, Mitchell Anderson, and Christian Peerzada. This includes:
